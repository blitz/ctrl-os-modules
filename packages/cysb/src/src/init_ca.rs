//! Create a new Secure Boot CA.
//!
//! # UEFI variables
//!
//! Secure Boot is configured by four UEFI variables:
//!
//! - `PK` (Platform Key) holds exactly one certificate. The holder of this key may update `PK` and `KEK`.
//! - `KEK` (Key Exchange Key) holds any number of certificates. The key of any of them may update `db` and `dbx`.
//! - `db` (signature database) holds certificates and hashes that allow UEFI binaries to run.
//! - `dbx` (forbidden signature database) holds certificates and hashes that forbid UEFI binaries from running. It
//!   takes precedence over `db`.
//!
//! Firmware only runs a UEFI binary if it is not forbidden by `dbx`, and either its hash is in `db` or it is signed by a
//! key whose certificate is in `db` or was issued by a certificate in `db`.
//!
//! # Keys
//!
//! This command creates three keys, each an RSA key with a self-signed certificate. Each certificate is intended to be
//! enrolled as an entry in one of the variables above:
//!
//! - The PK key. Its certificate is the single entry in `PK`.
//! - The KEK key. Its certificate is one entry in `KEK`, possibly next to others, such as Microsoft's.
//! - The db CA key. Its certificate is one entry in `db`. It does not sign UEFI binaries itself. Instead, it issues
//!   certificates for signing keys, which are typically generated in an HSM. Firmware accepts binaries signed by these
//!   keys, because their certificates were issued by a certificate in `db`. Signing keys can thus be replaced without
//!   updating `db`.
//!
//! All three keys are meant to be kept offline.
//!
//! # Owner GUID
//!
//! Each entry in the variables above records the GUID of its owner. This command creates a random GUID that identifies
//! our entries, e.g. to tell them apart from Microsoft's. It is written to `public/GUID.txt`.
